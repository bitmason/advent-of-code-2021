### Advent of Code 2021 ### 
My solutions for [Advent of Code 2021](http://adventofcode.com/2021). All solutions are original. All solutions work. I only got thru 14 days this year. 

I used two languages, for some exercise and education: ten days in [an old and stable Lisp](http://www.sbcl.org/), and four days in the new and constantly changing [Zig](https://ziglang.org). I've never coded professionally in either Common Lisp or Zig so my solutions strive for clarity but probably fail to be idiomatic or optimal.
