### Advent of Code 2021 ### 
My solutions for [Advent of Code 2021](http://adventofcode.com/2021). All solutions are original. All solutions work.

### Motivation ###
I wanted to use one very old and one very new language to complete this year's AoC. 

For me, this meant [an old, stable Lisp](http://www.sbcl.org/) and a new, constantly changing [Zig](https://ziglang.org). As of December 2021, Lisp is over 63 years old and Common Lisp is most of that. Meanwile, Zig is just five years old, has bugs, and regularly changes its language spec and standard libraries.

I've never coded professionally in either Common Lisp or Zig so my solutions strive for clarity but probably fail to be idiomatic or optimal.
