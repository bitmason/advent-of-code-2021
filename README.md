My solutions for [Advent of Code 2021](http://adventofcode.com/2021). All solutions are original. All solutions work.

### Motivation ###
I'm probably not going to finish all 25 days but I wanted to use one very old and one very new language in this year's AoC. 

For me, this meant [an old, stable Lisp](http://www.sbcl.org/) and a new, constantly changing [Zig](https://ziglang.org). As of December 2021, Lisp is over 63 years old and singularly stable. Meanwile, Zig is just five years old, full of bugs, and regularly changes its language spec and standard libraries. Both languages compile to very fast binaries. SBCL binaries are huge and fast. Zig binaries are small and fast. 

I've never coded professionally in either Common Lisp or Zig so my solutions strive for clarity but probably fail to be idiomatic or optimal.
